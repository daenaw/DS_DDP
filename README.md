Data Science Project - Shiny Application
==================================

This repository aims to implement a simple Shiny Application with the relevant documentation to instantly compute the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the entered inputs value for height (number of metres) and weight(number of kilograms).

The below files are being used in this repository.

1. ui.R - required to generate the shiny app
2. server.R - required to generate the shiny app
3. BMI_Project.md - Markdown file to generate the presentation 
4. BMI_Project.html - HTML file generated from the Markdown file 
   
   
Note that the BMI information used in this application is based on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)
